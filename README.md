# Tidal Bot
Tidal Bot, formerly known as Pearcel Bot, is a bot for Discord written by [MiningMark48](http://miningmark48.xyz) and collaboratively designed by [Tidal Wave](http://tw.miningmark48.xyz).

Tidal Bot is made in Java and uses the [Java Discord API](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA). Tidal Bot includes many commands, from fun entertainment commands to a custom music bot.

#### Key Features

- Music Bot with the ability to play and queue songs from SoundCloud and YouTube videos and even play live Twitch streams.
- Chat Bot with the ability to communicate with you with a set of predefined messages.
- and tons of commands.



In the future, I plan to release Tidal Bot as a standalone bot that can be downloaded and hosted by users.
